**smartmap** is an R package for previewing spatial data as 
[leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) maps. It 
is designed for interactive use and produces nice maps with minimal 
typing required. In contrast to other similar packages,
smartmap does not require an `sf` or `sp` object as input, but *just works* with
normal `data.frames` or `matrices` that have longitude and latitude columns.
See [the package homepage](https://s-fleck.github.io/smartmap/) for more 
infos.



## Installation

You can install smartmap from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("smartmap")
```

or get the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("s-fleck/smartmap")
```



## Example

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(smartmap)

# coordinate pairs without names are interpreted as longitude/latitude
smap(c(16.422524, 48.185686))

# if you supply column names, smap uses those to identify the correct columns
smap(c(LAT = 48.185686, LoNgItuDE = 16.422524))

# when supplied with an url or file system path, smap tries its best to discover
# supported spatial datasets
# Note: the naturalearthdata url doesn't work anymore and i didn't find another good new example
# smap("https://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/50m/cultural/ne_50m_admin_0_countries.zip")

# You can call smap() on existing leaflet objects to add background tiles and
# a ruler for measuring distance
library(leaflet)
lf <- leaflet::leaflet() %>% 
  leaflet::addCircleMarkers(lng = 16.422524, lat = 48.185686)

lf
smap(lf)
```
